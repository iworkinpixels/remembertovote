# remembertovote

A Chrome extension which uses the Google Civics API to remind you when to vote, and give you as much information as we can about your representatives.

TODO:
* Add voting info from Google Civics API.
* Add alarms at appropriate intervals before elections.
* Add alarms at appropriate intervals before deadlines for registration.
* Enable the creation of "slates" which can be uploaded to your Chrome in order to coordinate voting with other voters.
* Enable the ability to upload data that Google Civics doesn't have yet, or coordinate with the Voter Information Project in order to upload information there.
* Make it pretty!
